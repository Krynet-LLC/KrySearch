## How It Works

**KrySearch** operates as a **search router**, routing queries to search engines of your choice while protecting your privacy. Here’s how it works:

1. **User Input**: You enter a query or URL into the search bar.
2. **Search Routing**: The query is routed to the selected search engine without any tracking or storage of personal data.
3. **Return Results**: The results are displayed directly from the search engine, with no intermediary tracking or modification.

KrySearch supports multiple search engines, including privacy-focused open-source engines and traditional closed-source ones. You can switch between them according to your needs.

Extending KrySearch
KrySearch is open-source, and you can easily extend it with additional functionality. Here are some ideas if you want to add more features:

Adding a New Search Engine
You can extend KrySearch to include more search engines by modifying the search.js file. The search engine configuration is stored in the CONFIG object, which can be extended with more search engines.

Example:
```javascript
const engines = { 
  ...CONFIG.engines.open_source, 
  ...CONFIG.engines.closed_source,
  'new-engine': {
    name: 'New Engine',
    base: 'https://newengine.com/search?q=',
    mode: 'query'
  }
};
```
Customizing the UI
Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS to customize the appearance of KrySearch. For instance, you can change the theme, layout, or button styles to match your brand or personal preference.

Using External Plugins
You can also extend KrySearch using JavaScript plugins. To create a plugin, simply write your script and push it into the window.KRY_PLUGINS array. For example:
```javascript
window.KRY_PLUGINS.push({
  id: 'new-feature',
  description: 'Adds new feature to KrySearch',
  run() {
    // Add your custom logic here
  }
});
```
Make sure to follow the best practices for privacy and security when adding new features.
